# Causal Agent Pipeline Configuration

# Stage 1: Structure Proposal (Orchestrator)
# The orchestrator proposes dimensions, autocorrelations, time granularities, and DAG
structure_proposal:
  model: openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.5

# Stage 2: Dimension Population (Workers)
# Workers process chunks in parallel to populate dimensions and suggest graph edits
workers:
  model: openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001

# Stage 3: Identifiability & Sensitivity Analysis
# Uses DoWhy - no LLM needed

# Stage 4: Model Specification & Prior Elicitation
prior_elicitation:
  model: openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.5

# Stage 5: Intervention Analysis
# Uses PyMC - no LLM needed

# Data sampling settings
data:
  sample_chunks: 10  # Number of chunks to show orchestrator for structure proposal
  chunk_size: 50     # Lines per chunk during preprocessing
