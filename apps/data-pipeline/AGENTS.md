ALWAYS THINK VERY HARD

- Avoid running tests marked as `slow` unless you changed something that directly impacts them. In general always run the subset of tests that make sense for the changes.

- A B200 costs 6$/h on Modal so when you run GPU benchmarks be conscious of the costs.

- At the start of each session, check if `scratchpad/TODO.md` exists. If so, read it to understand where work left off. Only update it when the user explicitly ends the session. This file is gitignored and used for local continuity.

- Interpret `cp` as an alias for "commit and push".

- Every time you commit make sure to split commits atomically, avoiding clumping multiple increments into a single one.

- Every time you make a change to the file structure make sure to report it under Structure in the README

- NEVER edit files under `data/` during refactoring. These are evaluation/example data files, not source code.

- NEVER run evals (`inspect eval`, `uv run inspect eval`, etc.) unless explicitly asked. Evals cost money. Only run `uv run pytest tests/` for testing.

- NEVER add backwards compatibility code. This project is not deployed anywhere yet. When refactoring, completely replace old patterns with new ones - do not support both old and new formats simultaneously.

- ALWAYS run `uv run ruff check src/ tests/` before committing to catch linting errors. Use `uv run ruff check --fix src/ tests/` to auto-fix issues. For formatting, run `uv run ruff format src/ tests/`.

- ALWAYS encode structural assumptions as DAGs with explicit latent confounders. NEVER use ADMGs (bidirected edges) as user-facing representations. If unobserved confounding exists, model it as an explicit unobserved node (e.g., `U -> X`, `U -> Y`) rather than a bidirected edge (`X <-> Y`). ADMGs are only used internally for running y0's identification algorithm via projection.

# Terminology: Causal Modeling

We avoid "structural" due to SEM/SCM terminology collision:
- In SEM: "structural" loosely means "latent-to-latent relationships" (vs measurement)
- In SCM/Pearl: "structural" means the functional equations X_i = f_i(Pa_i, U_i)

**Use these terms instead:**

| Concept | Term | Domain |
|---------|------|--------|
| Latent-to-latent DAG (what LLM proposes) | **Latent model** | SEM distinction |
| Latent-to-observed mapping | **Measurement model** | SEM distinction |
| DAG encoding parent-child relationships | **Topological structure** | SCM distinction (y0) |
| Mathematical form of causal mechanisms | **Functional specification** | SCM distinction (NumPyro) |

# y0 (Causal Identification)

Docs: https://y0.readthedocs.io/
Theory: [docs/modeling/assumptions.md](docs/modeling/assumptions.md) (A3a for temporal unrolling)

## Design Principle

- **User-facing**: DAGs with explicit latent confounders (never ADMGs)
- **Internally**: Unroll to 2 timesteps, project to ADMG for ID algorithm
- See A3a in assumptions.md for why this works

## Identification Pattern

```python
from causal_ssm_agent.utils.identifiability import check_identifiability

result = check_identifiability(latent_model, measurement_model)
# See src/causal_ssm_agent/utils/identifiability.py for implementation
```
