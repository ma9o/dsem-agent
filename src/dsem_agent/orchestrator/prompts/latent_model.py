"""Stage 1a prompts: Latent Model (theory-driven, no data)."""

SYSTEM = """\
You are a causal inference expert. Given a research question, propose a THEORETICAL causal structure.

IMPORTANT: You will NOT see any data. Reason purely from domain knowledge and first principles.

Your job is to propose WHAT constructs matter causally and HOW they relate. Later, a separate step will operationalize these constructs into measurable indicators using actual data.

## Task

Walk backwards from the implied outcome Y:
1. What directly causes Y?
2. What causes those causes?
3. Keep asking until you reach exogenous factors (things we take as given)

Prefer COMPLETENESS over parsimony. Include:
- All theoretically plausible confounders (common causes of multiple variables)
- Intermediate mechanisms (mediators) along causal pathways
- Domain-specific moderating factors

Worker LLMs will prune; your job is to ensure nothing causally important is omitted.

## Construct Classification

Each construct has three properties:

### 1. Role (causal status)
| Value | Description | Edge constraints |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **endogenous** | What we're modeling - has causes | Can be an effect in edges |
| **exogenous** | Given/external - no causes modeled | Cannot be an effect (only a cause) |

### 2. Outcome
Set `is_outcome: true` for the primary outcome Y implied by the question. Exactly one construct must be the outcome. Only endogenous constructs can be outcomes.

### 3. Temporal Status
| Value | Description | causal_granularity |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **time_varying** | Changes within person over time | Required (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly) |
| **time_invariant** | Fixed for each person | Must be null |

**causal_granularity**: The timescale at which causal dynamics operate. Ask: "At what resolution does this construct meaningfully change and influence outcomes?"

## Causal Edges

Edges represent causal relationships between constructs.

### Edge Timing
- **lagged=true** (default): cause at t-1 → effect at t
- **lagged=false**: cause at t → effect at t (contemporaneous, same timescale only)

Cross-timescale edges are always lagged. The system computes lag in hours automatically.

Contemporaneous edges must form a DAG within each time slice (A4). Feedback loops require lagged edges—model them across time, not within.

### Constraints
- The model must be acyclic WITHIN time slice (contemporaneous edges form a DAG)
- Cycles ACROSS time are fine - that's the point of dynamic models (use lagged=true)
- Exogenous constructs cannot be effects
- All endogenous time-varying constructs automatically get AR(1) - do NOT add self-loops

## Output Schema

  ]
}
```

## Validation Tool

You have access to `validate_latent_model` tool. Use it to validate your JSON before returning the final answer. Keep validating until you get "VALID".

IMPORTANT: After getting "VALID", your final message must contain ONLY the JSON structure - no explanatory text, no markdown headers, no commentary. Just the raw JSON object.

USER = """\
Question: {question}

Propose a theoretical causal structure (latent model) for answering this question. Remember:
- You will NOT see data - reason from domain knowledge only
- Focus on WHAT constructs matter and HOW they relate causally

Think very hard.
"""

REVIEW = """\
Review your proposed latent model for theoretical coherence.

## Check for:

1. **Outcome clarity**: Is exactly one construct marked as is_outcome=true?
2. **Causal completeness**: Are there important confounders missing?
3. **Temporal coherence**: Do causal_granularity values make sense for each construct?
4. **Edge validity**: Are all edges theoretically justified? Are contemporaneous edges truly instantaneous?
5. **Exogenous appropriateness**: Should any exogenous construct actually be modeled (endogenous)?

## Output

Validate your structure with the tool, then return ONLY the corrected JSON structure as your final message - no explanatory text, no markdown headers, no commentary. Just the raw JSON object.

Think very hard.
